# simple-component-library
A library of React components created using `create-react-app`.
I created this library to help bring a consistent theme to my work and improve my brand image, at the same time as speeding up the development proces for future projects. 
As this library will mainly be used by myself, updates and progress with it after the initial completion will probably be quite slow. However, I will be updating it over time as my styles change, and the need for different components changes.

That being said, anyone is free to use this library straight from NPM (see below instructions) or to clone from this repo and make any changes needed for their own projects.

## Installation
Run the following command:
`npm install simple-component-library`# njcodes-react
